# TalkCards

## Setup Instructions

TalkCards is a simple, text-based game that encourages you to connect more deeply with the other party you are playing with. 

Create your own questions just by editing questions.csv or by creating a new .csv file! You can create new questions, create new categories, or change and remove entries as you like.

Share your terminal screen during video calls to get started!
